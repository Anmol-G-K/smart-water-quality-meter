# Smart Water Quality Meter üö∞

## 1. Project Overview

### üìå Problem Statement
Access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental need, yet many regions lack the infrastructure to monitor water quality efficiently. Manual water quality testing is time-consuming, costly, and requires expertise. There is a need for a **low-cost**, **real-time**, and **automated** solution to **continuously monitor water quality**, especially in remote areas.

### ‚úÖ Merits of the Project
- **Cost-effective** solution for water quality monitoring.
- **Real-time data** collection and analysis.
- Portable and easy to deploy in various environments.
- Can be integrated with **alert systems** or **IoT platforms** for remote monitoring.
- Promotes **clean water initiatives** and helps detect contamination early.

## 3. Steps on How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### a) **Working Principle of the Turbidity Sensor (DF Robot SEN0189)**

1. **Light Emission**: The sensor emits an **infrared light** through the water sample.
2. **Light Scattering**: Suspended particles in the water **scatter** the light.
3. **Detection**: A photodetector inside the sensor measures the **scattered light intensity**.
4. **Voltage Output**: Based on the amount of light detected, the sensor outputs an **analog voltage**.
5. **Turbidity Measurement**: The Raspberry Pi Pico reads this analog voltage and converts it into a **turbidity value**, typically expressed in **NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)**.

### b) **Procedure of Data Collection**

#### 1. **Hardware Setup**
- Connect the **VCC** of the SEN0189 to the **3.3V** pin of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- Connect **GND** to **GND** on the Pico.
- Connect the **Analog Output (A0)** of the sensor to **ADC0 (GP26)** on the Pico.

#### 2. **Software Setup**
- Install **Thonny IDE** on your laptop.
- Flash the **MicroPython UF2** firmware onto the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- Open Thonny and select **MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)** as the interpreter.

#### 3. **Programming**
- Write a Python script in Thonny to:
  - Read **analog values** from the sensor via the **ADC** pin.
  - Convert the analog signal into a **voltage** value.
  - Interpret voltage levels to determine **water clarity** (clean or dirty).

#### 4. **Data Interpretation**
- Based on the sensor output:
  - **Low turbidity (clean water)** gives **low voltage** readings.
  - **High turbidity (dirty water)** gives **high voltage** readings.
- Set thresholds to trigger **alerts** or **indicators** if turbidity crosses a critical level.
